    "text": "Rationale: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, yet limited data exist on where patients spend their final days. With rising emphasis on palliative and supportive care, understanding whether patients die in hospitals, at home, or in hospice facilities is crucial for identifying care gaps and improving end-of-life experiences. By examining sociodemographic predictors—such as age, race, ethnicity, and urbanization—this project will illuminate disparities, guide resource allocation, and help shape evidence-based policies that foster equitable access to palliative services. Ultimately, these findings will address an urgent need to ensure patients with advanced lung cancer receive care aligned with their needs and preferences, while informing clinical and policy decisions aimed at enhancing the quality and dignity of end-of-life care.\nReference Papers:\n\nAli et al., 2025\n\nStudy Objective: To investigate longitudinal trends and sociodemographic determinants of place of death among U.S. adults (≥45 years) with lung cancer (ICD-10: C34), focusing on the associations between age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, urbanization level, and end-of-life location.\nData Source: CDC WONDER Multiple Cause of Death database (1999–2023). This publicly available dataset captures detailed mortality information including underlying and contributing causes of death, patient demographics, and county-level characteristics.\nPatient Selection: Included all decedents aged ≥45 years with lung cancer (ICD-10: C34) recorded in the multiple-of-death field.\nOutcome of Interest: Place of Death, categorized into four mutually exclusive settings:\n\nInpatient medical facility (reference category)\nHome (decedent’s residence)\nHospice or nursing home\nOutpatient medical facility or emergency room\n\n\nThe following categories were excluded due to small counts or ambiguous classification: “Dead on Arrival,” “Status unknown,” “Other,” and “Place of death unknown.”\n\nStatistical Analysis:\n\nDescriptive Analysis: Summarized demographic characteristics across place of death using frequency distributions and compared using Pearson’s chi-square tests.\nAge-Adjusted Mortality Rates (AAMRs): Standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard population.
